## Introduction
Over the past week, laboratory work 5 on the topic "Working with matrices" was completed.

## Lab #5

As a result of the work, they learned how to fit polynomial curves and perform various matrix transformations using the Octave system for mathematical calculations.

**Completed tasks**

- Perform polynomial curve fitting with Octave.
- Represent the image using a matrix.
- Flip the image to a certain angle.
- Flip the image relative to a straight line.
- Perform deletion conversion.


## Conclusions

Over the past week, I have learned how to fit polynomial curves and perform various matrix transformations using the Octave math system.
