## Introduction
Over the past week, laboratory work No. 7 on the topic "Graphics in Octave" was completed.

## Lab #7

As a result of the work, we learned how to build graphs of various functions in Octave.

The following tasks were completed:

- Build parametric graphs
- Plot in polar coordinates
- Plot an implicit function
- Plot in a complex area
- Plot a special function

## Conclusions

Over the past week, I've been learning Octave's charting functions and getting hands-on with them. I learned how to build graphs of different functions in different coordinate systems and learned a lot of new things.
