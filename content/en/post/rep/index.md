### What is markdown and why is it used for reporting?

 Markdown is a text markup language created by writer and blogger John Gruber. It is designed to create beautifully designed texts in regular TXT files. You don't need bulky processors like Word or Pages to create documents with bold or italics, quotes, links, and even tables. It is enough to remember the simple rules of Markdown, and you can even write in Notepad.

 This markup language is used by bloggers, writers, editors and journalists around the world. And it is used for a reason, but due to the fact that you can use a certain template, which simplifies editing and designing the work. This language is very convenient for creating many reports of the same type, since you can take a suitable template and simply make the necessary changes each time without thinking about font size, indentation, the formation of a list of references, a list of illustrations, because all this is already automatically set.

## Technical part of the report design.

 In this part, we will look at the process of preparing a report using Markdown.

 First you need to download or create a template that suits you. Then just enter the information in the required fields. In addition to the report, it is necessary to create separate folders for the file with literature sources and pictures. In order to insert an image, you need to register the path to it using the form:
```
 ![Image title](image/placeimg_800_600_tech.jpg){ #fig:001 width=70% }
```
 There are also templates for formatting a file with a list of references, they should also include in the required fields information about the title of the book / electronic source, about the author, year of publication, publisher and the rest necessary for you. By placing links of this type `@tannenbaum:modern-os:ru]` in the text and compiling, you will have a generated bibliography.
 
Markdown also has other features, such as creating tables, formatting formulas and code. All this can be found by reading the information, for example, on this [website] (https://www.markdownguide.org/)
 

## Conclusions

A report is a structured statement of goals, process and results about some work done. It helps a person to better understand your actions and easily navigate the work done. Markdown is a convenient and easy to use lightweight markup language, great for reporting. Reporting is a very useful skill to learn and use.
