## Introduction

In this article, we will cover the following topics:

1. What is a version control system
2. What is Git
3. How to work with Git

## What is the version control system

Version control system (also used the definition of "version control system [1]", from the English. Version Control System, VCS or Revision Control System) - software to facilitate the work with changing information. The version control system allows you to store multiple versions of the same document, revert to earlier versions if necessary, determine who made a change and when, and much more.

### What is Git

Git is the absolute leader in popularity among modern version control systems. It is a mature project with active support and open source. Git was originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux operating system kernel. Git is used for version control by a huge number of software development projects, both commercial and open source. The system is used by many professional software developers. It runs great on a variety of operating systems and can be used with a variety of integrated development environments (IDEs).

## How to work with Git

In order to work with Git, you first need to register on [GitHub] (https://github.com/) - one of the services for using the Git version control system. Then install git, after that you should add the settings that you need. For example, make sure that each of your actions is marked with a name and mail. Then you need to create a remote repository or clone and connect to it. Changes are made to the local computer, and then transferred to the site using the commands git add (add files), git commit (comment on changes), git push (upload files to GitHub). To download changes made by someone else, use the git pull command.

## Conclusions

Git is a convenient and easy to use version control system. With it, you can track and commit changes to files, which makes it easier to work on a project with many people.
