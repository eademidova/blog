## Introduction
Over the past week, laboratory work 7 and 8 were completed on the following topics:

1. Command shell Midnight Commander.
2. Text editor vi.

## Lab #7

As a result of the laboratory work, I have my main features of the Midnight Commander command shell. Gained practical skills in viewing directories and files; ma-
nipulation with them.

The following tasks were completed:

- Learning information about mc.
- Practical work with mc.
- Learn mcedit hotkeys.
- Learn to work with files using mcedit.

## Lab #8

As a result of laboratory work, I got acquainted with the Linux operating system. Gained practical skills in working with the vi editor installed by default in almost all distributions.

The following tasks were completed:

- Learn the basic functions of the vi text editor
- Create a file with vi
- Edit file with vi

## Conclusions

Over the past week, I've been learning and working with the Midnight Commander shell. I also learned how to work with the vi text editor built into almost all linux distributions, which was unusual to use, but interesting. This experience will be very useful for me in my future studies and in general in life. In general, I am satisfied with the results of the past week, I completed all the work in advance and I did not have any particular difficulties.
