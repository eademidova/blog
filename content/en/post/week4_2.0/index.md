## Introduction
Over the past week, laboratory work No. 6 was implemented on a possible topic:

- Limits, traces, ranks and numerical union in Octave

## Lab #6

As a result of the work, we learned how to work with restrictions, sequences, series and perform numerical union in Octave.

Tasks were completed:

- Estimate limit.
- Find partial sums.
- Find the sum of the series.
- Calculate integral integral density.
- Calculate the integral according to the rules of the midpoint.

## Conclusions

Over the past week, I've learned how to work with retention, sequences, series, and numerical union in Octave.
