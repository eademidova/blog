## Introduction
Over the past week, laboratory work 3 and 4 were completed on the following topics:

1. Introduction to working with Octave
2. Systems of linear equations.

## Lab №3

As a result of the work, I learned how to perform basic calculations and draw the simplest two-dimensional graphs using the Octave system for mathematical calculations.

The following tasks were completed:

- Perform simple operations.
- Perform operations with vectors.
- Calculate projector.
- Perform matrix operations.
- Build simple graphs.
- Build two graphs on one drawing.
- Plot $y = x^2sin(x)$.
- Compare cycles and operations with vectors

## Lab №4

As a result of the work, I learned how to solve systems of linear equations using the Octave system for mathematical calculations.

The following tasks were completed:

- Solve SLAE using the Gauss Method
- Solve SLAE by applying left division
- Find LU decomposition
- Find LUP decomposition

## Conclusions

Over the past week, I've learned how to do basic calculations and draw basic 2D graphs using the Octave math system. I also learned how to solve systems of linear equations using the Octave math system.
